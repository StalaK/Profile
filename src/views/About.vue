        <p>Hi there, I'm Josh Hughes. A full stack software developer from Leeds, UK.</p>
        <p>
            I obtained a degree in Artificial Intelligence and Robotics back in 2013, where I then began a career as a software test consultant 
            specialising in automation testing. I had the opportunity to work in a variety of industries as a tester, including retail, manufacturing, 
            banking, and utilities. I also had additional roles on some projects such as a manual tester and a team lead.
        </p>
        <p>
            Looking for a new challenge and wanting to expand my programming skills further, I transitioned into software development in 2018 where I've held roles
            in the finance and manufactuing industries.
        </p>
        <p>I have experience with the following technologies:</p>
